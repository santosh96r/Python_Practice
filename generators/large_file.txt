The President of India is the head of the State and the highest constitutional authority of the country. This position is defined in the Indian Constitution under Article 52. The President is also the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces and holds great dignity and respect, even though the role is largely ceremonial. The President is elected by an Electoral College consisting of Members of Parliament and State Legislatures, and serves a term of five years, with the possibility of re-election.

To be eligible, a candidate must be an Indian citizen and at least thirty-five years old. The President takes an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution. All laws and bills passed by Parliament require the Presidentâ€™s assent before they can become an Act. During emergencies, the President has the power to make special decisions. The President also appoints the Prime Minister, Governors of states, Judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts, and Ambassadors of India.

Although these powers exist, most decisions are taken on the advice of the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers. The official residence of the President is the Rashtrapati Bhavan in New Delhi. The first President of India was Dr. Rajendra Prasad, who was elected in 1950. The President represents the unity and integrity of the nation and plays an important role in maintaining the democratic spirit of the country.

Every year, the President hoists the National Flag on Republic Day and delivers an important speech. On the eve of Independence Day, the President also addresses the nation. The current President of India, Droupadi Murmu, is the first tribal woman to hold this prestigious office. The President stands as a symbol of national pride, strength, and democracy. Truly, the office of the President is a pillar of the Indian Republic.
